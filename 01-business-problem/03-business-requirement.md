# **Why This Matters and Must Be Addressed**

- **Supplier experience risk:** Errors and delays affect supply continuity and pricing.
- **Compliance & reputational exposure:** Multi-jurisdictional penalties and audits.
- **Strategic misalignment:** Finance should drive insights and working capital—not manual data entry.
- **Weak Audit Trail:** Manual processes create fragmented or incomplete audit logs, increasing compliance risk and making audits time-consuming and costly.

# **Business Driver for Automation**
- **Scalability:** Decouple cost from volume growth; absorb increases without linear FTE adds.
- **Accuracy:** Reduce error rate sharply for fewer disputes and faster cycle times.
- **SLA Reliability:** Minimize breaches and penalty exposure.
- **Global Standardization:** Central controls with local compliance.
- **Measurable ROI:** Tangible cost-out, quality improvements, and vendor experience gains.
- **Enhanced Auditability and Compliance:** Ensure a complete, tamper-proof audit trail for every invoice action, meeting regulatory requirements.
