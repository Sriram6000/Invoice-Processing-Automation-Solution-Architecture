# Architecture Patterns

This section focuses on **Pattern 1: High Volume / Scalable**, as it directly supports the business problem of processing millions of invoices across 20 countries.  

To demonstrate architectural flexibility and trade-off analysis, I have also explored **two alternate patterns** considering **volume, cost, performance, scalability, and operational constraints**. These patterns provide options for organizations with different scale and complexity requirements.

## Contents

- Pattern 1: High Volume / Scalable  
  *Designed for global operations with millions of invoices per year; focuses on scalability, resilience, and performance.*  
- Pattern 2: Mid Volume / Balanced
  *Balances cost and performance with moderate complexity.*  
- Pattern 3 : Low Volume / Cost-Optimized  
  *Ideal for small-scale operations; prioritizes simplicity and minimal infrastructure cost.*  
- Comparison Table (Trade-offs)  
  *Summarizes key differences across patterns: cost, scalability, complexity, and recommended use cases.*

## Navigation Guide
- Start with **[Pattern 1](pattern-1-high-volume.md)** for detailed design and diagrams.
- Review **[Pattern 2](pattern-2-mid-volume.md) and [Pattern 3](pattern-3-low-volume.md)** for alternative approaches (currently placeholders).
- Use the **[Comparison Table](comparison-table.md)** to understand trade-offs and select the right pattern for your scenario.
