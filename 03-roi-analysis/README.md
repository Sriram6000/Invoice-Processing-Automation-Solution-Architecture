# ROI Analysis
---

This section quantifies the **financial impact** of automating AP invoice processing for GobalCrop Ltd..  
It follows a structured path: **Assumptions → Manual Baseline → Automated Scenario (Pattern 1) → Savings & ROI → Sensitivity**.

> **Focus:** Pattern 1 — *High Volume – Azure Blob & Functions Architecture* — aligns with the current business need (millions of invoices/year, strict SLA & compliance).

- [Assumptions](./assumptions.md)
- [Cost of Baseline (Manual)](./cost-of-baseline-manual.md)
- [Cost of Automated Scenario (Pattern 1)](./cost-of-automated-scenario.md)
- [Savings & ROI](./savings-and-roi.md)
- [Sensitivity Cases](./sensitivity-cases.md)

## How to Read This
1. Start with **Assumptions** (operational & financial drivers).
2. Review **Manual Baseline** to understand the “cost of doing nothing.”
3. See **Automated Scenario (Pattern 1)** for the target-state cost model.
4. Use **Savings & ROI** for payback, 3‑year savings, and (optionally) NPV/IRR.
5. Check **Sensitivity** to see how results vary under different conditions.

> **Auditability:** Beyond cost, automation delivers **complete, tamper‑proof audit trails** across capture → validation → approvals → posting. This materially reduces compliance risk and audit effort and should be highlighted in business discussions.
